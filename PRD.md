# Singular Code Review Product Contract

## Purpose

Singular Code Review provides actionable, evidence-backed pull-request review with the consistency of a managed application and the repository awareness of a coding agent. The current repository owns the review engine, image, reusable GitHub Actions workflow, and evaluation harness. Account, subscription, and repository-management surfaces are future control-plane work.

## Product goals

- Find material correctness, intent, architecture, testing, documentation, and maintainability issues without manufacturing feedback.
- Produce concise author-ready inline comments and a non-repetitive main review body.
- Keep ordinary reviews fast enough for interactive pull-request work and make contained follow-up pushes substantially cheaper.
- Support OpenCode in production while keeping the AML workflow portable to other ACP providers.
- Make the complete model workflow understandable from one declarative JSX blueprint.
- Keep side effects, validation, trust checks, and publication deterministic.

## Non-goals

- Automatic merge or approval.
- Review of fork code with repository secrets.
- A second full-PR investigation during audit or synthesis.
- Comment quotas, forced findings, or severity inflation to satisfy a score.
- File-backed handoffs between Agents.
- Provider-specific orchestration hidden behind a custom runner.

## Review contract

One accepted run freezes the pull-request head and gathers:

- PR title, body, author, refs, commits, and changed-file manifest;
- a filtered unified diff and valid GitHub comment ranges;
- issue comments, reviews, review comments, thread state, and action items;
- previous bot activity needed for re-review decisions.

The application materializes pr.md, pr.diff, and history.md for Agent evidence. Everything else remains typed and request-local.

Six parallel lanes investigate distinct concerns:

1. intent and contract;
2. repository standards and architecture;
3. changed-code paths and bugs;
4. correctness risk and testing;
5. documentation and commentary;
6. maintainability and elegance.

Each lane stages final author text through add_review_comment, add_review_reply, or the exceptional add_review_blocker Tool. A concern that was not staged does not exist for downstream phases.

Audit receives the staged queue and only enough PR/history context to identify duplicates, stale feedback, and disproportionate findings. It may merge IDs, lower an anchored inline severity, or drop findings. It cannot create or re-investigate a finding, rewrite its author text, evidence, or anchor, promote severity, reclassify a question, or demote an anchorless blocker.

The deterministic ReviewQueue owns:

- changed path, line, range, and side validity;
- top-level review-reply targets;
- exact duplicate suppression;
- matching unresolved or previously posted bot feedback;
- the final GitHub payload shape.

Synthesis receives the validated findings and an application-owned verdict. It writes the short pull-request overview, optional direct answer, and optional cross-finding Recommendations. It does not repeat inline concerns.

## Verdict policy

- A retained review-level blocker or critical inline finding blocks.
- A retained high, low, or unresolved question finding requests changes.
- Replies do not determine merge readiness.
- Nit-only and empty reviews are LGTM.

`low` is a default fix-before-merge recommendation for a concrete defect, contract problem, or material structural debt that a human may override with a reason. `nit` is explicitly safe to leave unchanged.

Severity belongs to the concrete impact, not the absence of an inline anchor. The blocker Tool is reserved for a high-confidence critical issue that makes the pull request fundamentally unsafe to land and cannot honestly target one changed line.

## Follow-up and conversation behavior

The gate may answer a direct question or fast-track a no-review LGTM when the current head was already reviewed or a narrow delta clearly resolves prior feedback without introducing adjacent risk. New behavior, broad deltas, unresolved findings, explicit re-review requests, and uncertainty require the full review.

Replies to existing inline threads remain inline replies. Top-level questions or instructions may receive a short direct answer before the review summary.

## Reliability

- Any failed parallel lane fails the full review.
- An incomplete provider attempt never produces a publishable result.
- Audit failure never falls back to unaudited lane output.
- Publication verifies the current head against the reviewed head.
- Model execution starts only when the checked-out commit matches the API snapshot.
- Prepared GitHub writes are idempotent within a run.
- An ambiguous mutation outcome is recorded and never replayed.
- Dry run is the default CLI mode; live mutation requires --publish.

The workflow's 40-minute process ceiling is a stuck-provider safety boundary, not an expected review duration. Performance is measured separately in evals.

## Security

- Preflight rejects fork heads, untrusted or bot triggers, missing resources, and explicit skip directives before App-token creation and checkout.
- The workflow uses pull_request and issue_comment, never pull_request_target.
- Target dependency installation is opt-in and assumes trusted contributors.
- Agents receive a read-only filesystem, no native shell, no native network, staged-finding Tools, focused read-only GitHub reference Tools, and the explicit Context7 MCP. Snapshot reads and publication remain application-owned.

## Operations and evaluation

Production uses OpenCode with opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash by default. The model and maximum Agent concurrency are selected once at the runtime edge.

Every eval capture preserves the raw typed result, provider/model identity, immutable image identity, exact PR revisions, judge views, timing, usage, and completion state. Exit zero alone is insufficient; required artifacts and a complete typed review must exist before judgment or cache promotion.

## Managed-service acceptance criteria

The future hosted product must add, without weakening the engine contract:

- subscription and installation ownership;
- repository selection and per-repository options;
- encrypted provider/GitHub credentials;
- durable job leases, retries, cancellation, and concurrency;
- auditable traces and result retention;
- usage accounting and plan enforcement;
- image/version rollout with rollback;
- a clear boundary between control-plane state and isolated review execution.
